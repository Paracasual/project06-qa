# Urban Lunch Mobile App Testing Project

## Project Overview
The **Urban Lunch App** is an Android application designed to allow users to order meals from various restaurants in the city and pick them up from designated locations. My role in this project was to ensure the app's functionality, performance, and reliability by designing and executing a comprehensive mobile testing strategy.

## Skills and Tools Used
- **Android Studio**: For emulating various Android devices and debugging issues.
- **Mobile Emulators**: Used for testing the app across different device configurations and Android versions.
- **Mobile Testing**: Functional testing, defect identification, and resolution.

## Key Contributions
1. **Developed and Implemented a Mobile Testing Strategy**:
   - Created a detailed testing plan tailored to the app's core functionality and user flows.
   - Utilized Android Studio and mobile emulators to test the app's features across different screen sizes and operating systems.

2. **Identified and Resolved Critical Defects**:
   - Detected bugs by systematically testing all app features, including meal ordering, restaurant search, and pickup point selection.
   - Collected and analyzed bug reports to identify root causes and ensured fixes were implemented effectively.

## Testing Scope
- **Functionality Testing**:
  Verified the core features, such as restaurant browsing, meal selection, order placement, and pickup coordination.
  
- **Usability Testing**:
  Ensured that the app's user interface was intuitive and easy to navigate for a seamless user experience.

- **Regression Testing**:
  Ensured that newly added features or bug fixes did not impact existing functionality.

## Outcomes
- Delivered a detailed report of all identified issues, categorized by severity and priority.
- Improved the app's reliability by working closely with developers to resolve critical defects.
- Helped the team launch a robust initial version of the Urban Lunch App that met user expectations.
