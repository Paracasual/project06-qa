# Urban Lunch

## Project Summary:
Urban Lunch is an Android application designed to simplify meal orders by connecting users to various restaurants across the city. The app allows customers to place orders from their favorite eateries and pick them up at designated locations. This project also included a focus on a courier-side interface for order management and delivery.

The testing process for this project emphasized quality assurance through extensive functional testing of the mobile application. Android Studio and device emulators were key tools used to simulate different testing environments and ensure a seamless user experience.
